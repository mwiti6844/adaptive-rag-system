# Adaptive Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System

This project implements an Adaptive Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that adapts its retrieval strategy based on the type of user query. By leveraging Language Models (LLMs) and various retrieval strategies, the system provides more accurate, relevant, and context-aware responses.

## Objectives

- Query Classification: Classify user queries into categories like Factual, Analytical, Opinion, or Contextual.
- Adaptive Retrieval Strategies: Implement tailored strategies to retrieve relevant document chunks based on the query type.
- Response Generation: Use LLMs to generate coherent and contextually appropriate responses.
- Visualization: Visualize embeddings to understand the relationships between different document chunks.

## Features

- PDF content loading and processing
- Document chunking and embedding generation
- Vector search using FAISS
- Query classification using OpenAI's GPT-4o mini
- Multiple retrieval strategies (Factual, Analytical, Opinion, Contextual)
- Response generation using OpenAI's GPT-4o mini
- Visualization of document embeddings using PCA or t-SNE


## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- OpenAI API key

The system will process the document, generate embeddings, and be ready to answer queries.


## Applications

The Adaptive Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System has a wide range of potential applications across various domains:

1. **Research and Academia**: Assist researchers in quickly finding relevant information from large academic papers or datasets.

2. **Customer Support**: Provide accurate and context-aware responses to customer queries, improving support efficiency.

3. **Legal Document Analysis**: Help legal professionals extract and analyze information from large volumes of legal documents.

4. **Medical Information Retrieval**: Aid healthcare professionals in accessing relevant medical information from extensive databases.

5. **Educational Tools**: Create intelligent tutoring systems that can answer students' questions across various subjects.

6. **Content Curation**: Assist content creators in finding relevant information for article writing or content development.

7. **Business Intelligence**: Help analysts extract insights from large corporate documents and reports.

8. **Policy Analysis**: Aid policymakers in understanding complex policy documents and their implications.

9. **Technical Documentation**: Provide developers and engineers with quick access to relevant information in large technical documentation.

10. **Market Research**: Assist researchers in extracting insights from extensive market reports and consumer data.

The system's ability to adapt its retrieval strategy based on query type makes it versatile and applicable in scenarios where efficient and accurate information retrieval is crucial.
